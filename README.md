Personal Portfolio Site
=======================

This is my 2025 personal dev portfolio website built with Astro (https://astro.build). Itâ€™s a simple, fast, static site designed to showcase my GitHub projects, introduce who I am, and provide a way to get in touch... and maybe something else?

Features
--------

- Homepage: Short introduction with navigation links
- About: A little bit about me, my background, and what I care about
- Projects: A list of selected GitHub projects with links and brief descriptions
- Contact: Form to send me a message via EmailJS (https://www.emailjs.com)
